there are 3 different amplifers, a voltage-regulator and some experiments

1. single ended lowpower amplifer
    - 3.3V power supply
    - < 3.5mA current including powering of a laser-diode
    - > 30dB gain at 1GHz
    - 0..60°C
    - low-pass corner programable via capacitor

2. dual input differential lowpower amplifer
    - 3.3V power supply
    - < 3.5mA current including powering of a laser-diode
    - > 10dB gain at 1GHz
    - 0..60°C

3. differential lowpower amplifer
    - 3.3V power supply
    - < 3.5mA current including powering of a laser-diode
    - 0dB gain at 1GHz
    - 0..60°C
    
4. shunt-regulator 3.3V
    - max. 50mA
    - delta tc = 0 @ 10..30°C
    - trimable
    - possiblity for low pass filter

5. teststructure for RPPD matching
    - see differences in x and y build resistors, does it really matter?
    - see differences in middle and edge restisors, do we need dummy resistors?

6. a sg13g2 transisor
    - if nothing else is working, we get at least a transistor :)

7. open, short & load
    - to calibrate the pads and connections out, and measure the impedances of the amplifiers
